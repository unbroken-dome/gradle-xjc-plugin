= Controlling XJC Behavior

The link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/xjc.html[command line version] of XJC supports
a number of arguments to fine-tune the code generation. The XJC Gradle plugin supports many of these as properties
which can be set in the build script.

The link:https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jaxb-ri/3.0.0/docs/ch04.html#tools-xjc[Jakarta command line version] of XJC documentation.

The following properties are available in the project-scoped `xjc` block, and apply to all XJC invocations
(for all source sets):

|===
| Property | Description | Equivalent `xjc` CLI flag | Default

| `targetVersion` (`String`)
| The version of the JAXB specification to target.
| `-target`
| (use latest version supported by the XJC tool version in use)

| `docLocale` (`String`)
| The locale to be used when running XJC. This may influence the language of documentation comments in XJC-generated files.
| (no equivalent)
| JVM default locale

| `encoding` (`String`)
| The encoding for generated files.  This is supported by XJC 2.2 and later.
| `-encoding` (non-standard)
| `UTF-8`

| `strictCheck` (`Boolean`)
| Perform strict schema validation.
| `-nv` (if `false`)
| `true`

| `packageLevelAnnotations` (`Boolean`)
| Generate package-level annotations into `package-info.java` files.
| `-npa` (if `false`)
| `true`

| `noFileHeader` (`Boolean`)
| Suppress the generation of a file header comment that includes some note and timestamp.
| `-no-header`
| `true`

| `enableIntrospection` (`Boolean`)
| Fix getter/setter generation to match the Bean introspection API.
| `-enableIntrospection` (non-standard)
| `false`

| `contentForWildcard` (`Boolean`)
| Generates content property for types with multiple `xs:any` derived elements (which is
  supposed to be correct behavior).
| `-contentForWildcard` (non-standard)
| `false`

| `readOnly` (`Boolean`)
| Write-protect the generated Java source files.
| `-readOnly`
| `false`

| `extension` (`Boolean`)
| Enable JAXB vendor extensions.
| `-extension`
| `false` (`true` if any `-X...` argument is present in `extraArgs`)
|===

The following property is available for each source set:

|===
| Property | Description | Equivalent `xjc` CLI flag | Default

| `xjcTargetPackage` (`String`)
| The target package for XJC.
| `-p`
| (not set)

== JAXB Target Specification Version compatibility

The version of JAXB and the version of XJC are not necessarily consistent.  The JAXB specification
version follows the relevant JSR process while the XJC tool is updated in its maintenance lifecycle.

The XJC -target option which is configured via `targetVersion` is the mechanism to use to override
the default.  The following table is only known for the `com.sun.xml.bind` implementation of XJC.

TIP: Some XJC tool versions may downgrade the default JAXB target (to 2.1) if they do not find a
     2.2+ version of `javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api` on the XJC tool classpath.  For example if the `jaxb-api`
     dependency is missing from the classpath because your configuration overrides plugin defaults.

|===
| XJC Tool Version | Default JAXB Spec Version | JAXB -target support | Package

| 2.1 to 2.1.7
| 2.1
| 2.1, 2.0
| javax

| 2.1.8+
| 2.2
| 2.2, 2.1, 2.0
| javax

| 2.2
| 2.2
| 2.2, 2.1, 2.0
| javax

| 2.3
| 2.2
| 2.2, 2.1, 2.0
| javax

| 2.4
| 2.2
| 2.2, 2.1, 2.0
| javax

| 3.0
| 3.0
| 3.0, 2.3
| jakarta

| 4.0
| 3.0
| 3.0, 2.3
| jakarta

== JAXB Target Package compatibility

This table maybe a useful reference.

TIP: When expecting `jarkarta` package output, ensure to remove `javax.xml.bind:bind-api` from the XJC classpath.

|===
| XJC Tool Version | Default JAXB package | Supported package

| 2.1 to 2.1.7
| javax
| javax

| 2.1.8+
| javax
| javax

| 2.2
| javax
| javax

| 2.3
| javax
| javax

| 2.4
| javax
| javax

| 3.0
| jakarta
| jakarta (with -target 3.0) +
  javax (with -target 2.3)


| 4.0
| jakarta
| jakarta (with -target 3.0) +
  javax (with -target 2.3)

== XJC Tool runtime Java compatibility

This table maybe a useful reference, this only concerns the standard `com.sun.xml.bind`
implementation and the contents of the jaxb-xjc.jar itself.

Inaccuracies may exist in this table, but it demonstrates some possible unexpected
inconsistencies to look into when working with some versions of the XJC tool.


|===
| XJC Tool Version | Java Version

| 2.1
| Java SE 5

| 2.2 to 2.2.5
| Java SE 5

| 2.2.6+
| Java SE 6

| 2.3.0-b170127.1453 and 2.3.0.1
| Java SE 7 (JDK6+ com/sun/xml/dtdparser/*.class, no JDK9+ module-info.class provided but JDK9+ Options.class)

| 2.3.0
| Java SE 7 (JDK6+ com/sun/xml/dtdparser/*.class, no JDK9+ module-info.class provided but XJC2Task/CatalogUtil still provided)

| 2.3.1
| Java SE 7 (JDK9+ module-info.class provided)

| 2.3.2
| Java SE 7 (removed JDK9+ module-info.class but XJC2Task/CatalogUtil still provided)

| 2.3.3+
| Java SE 8 (JDK9+ module-info.class provided)

| 2.4.x
| Java SE 7 (JDK8+ com/sun/xml/dtdparser/*.class, JDK9+ module-info.class provided)

| 3.x
| Java SE 8 (JDK9+ module-info.class provided)

| 4.x
| Java SE 11

== Configuring XJC with Gradle Project Properties

As an alternative to configuring the above settings in your build script, you can use Gradle project
properties, either from a `gradle.properties` file or passed on the command line using the `-P` switch.
The property name correspond to the dot-separated path of the DSL properties.

Gradle properties are automatically picked up by subprojects in a multi-project build, so they are
especially useful for configuring multiple projects at once.

For example:

[source,properties]
.gradle.properties
----
xjc.xjcVersion=2.3
xjc.targetVersion=2.2
xjc.docLocale=en
xjc.strictCheck=false
xjc.enableIntrospection=true
xjc.contentForWildcard=true
xjc.verbosity=quiet
----

To selectively override properties for a Gradle build, use the `-P` switch on the command line:

[source,bash]
----
gradle build -Pxjc.verbosity=verbose
----


NOTE: Using Gradle properties has lower precedence than explicitly setting them in your
build script.
